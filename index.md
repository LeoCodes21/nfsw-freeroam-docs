## Welcome

This is an attempt to document the Need for Speed: World free-roam protocol.

## The Story of World
Need for Speed: World was an online MMO racing game, developed by EA BlackBox (later renamed to Quicklime Games.)

On July 14th of 2015, the servers for Need for Speed: World were closed. Luckily, an offline server was created, so offline play was possible.

Now, with recent events, online play (racing, free-roam) may be possible once again. But first... we need to know how this stuff works!

Enjoy my horrible explanations of the protocol.
