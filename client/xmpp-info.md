## XMPP Info Packet

### Introduction
This packet contains the **channel identifier** of the player's XMPP channel. (example: `channel.GN__1`) Generally this has no use, except for individual channel sessions.

### Contents
The only useful piece of information in this packet is the **channel identifier**.
The **channel identifier** can be located at indexes 4-17, or, with 1-based indexes, 5-18.

Other than that, there appears to be nothing useful in this packet.
